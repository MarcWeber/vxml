vxml, my attempt to create a validating xml library
====================================================

Howto install:
  You'll need a patched version (http://mawercer.de/~nix/repos/haxml.tar.gz) of HaXml
  to be able to read the provided
  dtds/xhtml1-20020801/DTD/xhtml1-strict_onefile.dtd file.



Credits to:
  * Saizan for helping me figuring out why ghc didn't find the right instance more
    than once
  * Oleg Kiselyov for telling me about the fastest TypeEq implementation. Before
    that typechecking a minimal xhtml document took hours, it takes 10sec now
