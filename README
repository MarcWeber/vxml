vxml, my attempt to create a validating xml library
====================================================

Howto install:
  You'll need a patched version (http://mawercer.de/~nix/repos/haxml.tar.gz) of HaXml
  to be able to read the provided
  dtds/xhtml1-20020801/DTD/xhtml1-strict_onefile.dtd file.

Validation errors are are shown in different ways:
* wrong element:
  Go down to the last "no instance for" message where no st or st' appears
  (but something like State22). You can look that up in the
  autogenerated-code/*.dtd files to get hint which elements should have come
  next.
* more elements expected:
  You should get a missing instance for ElEndable
* invalid attribute:
  missing instance for AttrOk elType attrType
* duplicate attribute:
  no instance for DuplicateAttribute
* missing required attributes:
  no instance for
  class RequiredAttributesMissing elType (HList  < missing attributes> )
* is a description missing here?

Credits to:
  * Saizan for helping me figuring out why ghc didn't find the right instance more
    than once
  * Oleg Kiselyov for telling me about the fastest TypeEq implementation. Before
    that typechecking a minimal xhtml document took hours, it takes 10sec now
    After his second suggestion I was able to bring down compilation time to acceptable 4 secs.
    (has been 30secs before for 12 lines of xml)
